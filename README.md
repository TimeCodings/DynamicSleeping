Hey, thanks for viewing this page! This plugin was a wish by @LKits (https://www.spigotmc.org/members/1176441/)! Because I did'nt communicated with the other dev who created this wish for him there are now 2 plugins like this on the market (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/...ht-based-on-percent-of-players-in-bed.107245/). This Plugin still contains A LOT OF bugs and errors, thats why you should send me any error or bug in my discord (https://discord.gg/8QWmU4ebCC)! Thanks!

**Whats Dynamic Sleeping?**
"With Dynamic Sleeping you're able to make the world-time goes faster for every player which sleeps" Example: If 1/10 players are sleeping, then time goes faster +10%, if 2/10, then +20%, if 10/10, then +100%. Dynamic Sleeping contains a big config.yml where you change like every option.
Over time I even lost track of them, which means that there are now some bugs :/ I don't need to say more at the moment because everything is described in the config and if you need help (IT'S AN ALPHA, thats why I ask that you do not use the review section to report bugs) write me on Discord (via ticket or DM)

**Features:**
- Set the TimeToSleep, TooLateForSleep and TimeToWakeUp ticks (you can customize all)
- Setup a default animation with custom speed and ticks

- Start the Animation when a player sleeps (automaticly without custom options)
- Add Custom Animations: With If Statement, Increase, Exactly, EveryTime and CustomSpeed/PerTicks option
